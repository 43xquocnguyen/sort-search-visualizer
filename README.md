This's a simple program to visualize two basic algorithms as Sorting and Searching.

But this's incompleted and has many flaws.

And I will try my best to do better in the future. If you have any comments for me, you can send me by emails. Thanks a lot!

I just built on some simple algorithms:
  * Search: Linear, Binary, Jump.
  * Sort: Interchange, Bubble, Shaker, Insertion, Selection, Binary Insertion.
